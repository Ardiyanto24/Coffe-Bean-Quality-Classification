# ☕ Coffee Bean Classification

Image-based Multi-Class Classification with Transfer Learning & Hyperparameter Tuning

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying coffee beans into multiple classes using image data.
The goal is to build a robust and well-diagnosed image classification pipeline, starting from deep EDA, followed by careful preprocessing, baseline modeling, model diagnosis, and systematic hyperparameter tuning.

The project is designed with a Kaggle-style, ML Engineer–oriented workflow, where each phase is implemented in a separate notebook to ensure clarity, reproducibility, and traceability.
